Short instruction for build RNTrack in cygwin enviroment

1. Preparation: install cygwin

1.1. Go to official Cygwin site http://www.cygwin.com/ and download
universal Cygwin installer cygwin.exe.

1.2. Select and install following additional components of Cygwin:
- from "Devel" branch:
  * binutils: The GNU assembler, linker and binary utilities
  * byacc: The Berkeley LALR parser generator
  * gcc: C compiler upgrade helper
  * make: The GNU version of the 'make' utility

1.3. Run cygwin shell and compile RNTrack.

Run the cygwin shell (double-click the desktop icon "Cygwin").
In the bash (shell window) change directory to RNTrack sources.

Expample.

If rntrack unpacked into OS directory "C:\rntrack.src\" you should
run following command in the bash:

  cd /cygdrive/c/rntrack.src

Now current directory is "C:\rntrack.src\"

  cd MakeFiles/cygwin
  make

after make stops, you may find file "rntrack_win32.exe" in the directory
"C:\rntrack.src\MakeFiles\cygwin". This file is RNTrack/w32 executable.
