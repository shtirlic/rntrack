Q0: When you will (add my favourite feature | fix bug xxx | do something)?

    think that OpenSource developers are your personal slaves." (c) FreeAmp FAQ

Q1: I want to catch letters containing UUE, how can I do it?
A1: You can use this mask and it's modifications:
    BodyMask: "*%0d%begin ### *.*%0d%m*%0d%m*%0d%`%0d%end*" * *

    This mask will catch files containing the following lines:
    --------------------
    begin 666 myfile.txt
    M....
    M....
    some-some-some
    `
    end
    --------------------

    This mask is the most precise, but it won't catch splitted messages.
    In fact you can use the fact lines in a usual UUE-file start with
    letter 'M'.
    BodyMask: "*%0d%M$$$$$$$$*%0d%M$$$$$$$$*%0d%M$$$$$$$$*%0d%m*%0d%M$$$$$$$$*" * *
    This mask will catch all letters contatining five lines starting with
    symbol 'M' and _not_ having a space within 8 symbols following this 'M'
    (ATTENTION! It's not necessary that these lines must be in order;
    they should simply exist)
    ------------------
    If you have any other checked mask please send it to me and the mask
    will be added to this FAQ.

A1: (Roman Rakitin, 2:5025/51.25)

    I noticed that no one mask that catches UUE doesn't catch them properly 
    if files were uuencoded by UUEPro. I solved the problem the following way
    and tested it on all available coders:
 
    ===[The beginning of WindowsClipboard]===
    *begin ### .*M$$$$$$%0d%M$$$$$$%0d%M$$$$$$%0d%M$$$$$$%0d%*\
    section*of file.M$$$$$$%0d%M$$$$$$%0d%M$$$$$$%0d%M$$$$$$%0d%*\
    sum -r/size*
    (This is one line. I simply splitted it into several parts for conveniency)
    ===[The end of WindowsClipboard]===


Q2: I want to move letters from netmail to echomail. How can I do it?
A2: The most correct way is to create a template containing the following:
    ------------
    @MsgBody
    @MsgNTearline
    @MsgNOrigin
    ------------
    All these words should start from the beginning of line and, using
    Action: NewMsg command they should put new letters to chosen echoarea.
    Why to do only thus way? Because in echomail TearLine and Origin _must_
    be present. But they're not obligatory necessary in netmail. Using this
    template we create a letter where TearLine and Origin always present.
    Also we delete all technical information that concerns only netmail and
    that is not used in echomail.

Q3: I want to move messages from echomail to netmail. How can I do it?
A3: In general this operation doesn't differ from moving messages from
    netmail to echomail, with the exception of only one small but important
    moment- there is not recepient's address in echomail. His name exists, but
    his address- not. That's why in 99% of cases you address will be placed
    as recepient's address, and in 1%, that is left, there could be anything.
    That's why when we move messages from echomail to netmail we should
    clearly show to RNtrack the address of the recepient. For example:
    Action: NewMsg "e_to_n.tpl" "o:\netmail\fromecho" * * * 2:5030/9999.0 * *
