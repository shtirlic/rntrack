                    What you need to do if RNtrack halts
                    with message "Internal Error!!! Please,
                    read report.err in documentation."

1. Try to understand at which moment the error occured.  Check for the
latest available version. If it's available, try it. Maybe, the error has
already been fixed.

2. Find file RNtrack.err.  It should have been created in current directory.

3. Put "LogLevel: 5" in config, and run RNtrack once again.

4. Send me the following files:
   * RNtrack.err
   * RNtrack.cfg
   * RNtrack.log
   * *.msg - if RNtrack halts on a certain letter.
   * What RNtrack put on the screen before halt.
   * Indicate type and version of your OS.
   * Indicate the location of stars and moon phase, if you are certain that
     it affects the error.
   * Indicate EVERYTHING, that you think might help to find the error.

5. Describe the problem in _details_.  In looking for bugs there is no such
thing as "too little info".

6. Send all this information to me either to 2:5030/1157 or ph0enix@users.sourceforge.net

With best regards,
                  Alex
